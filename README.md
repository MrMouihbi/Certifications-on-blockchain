# Certifications on blockchain

Informations on the blockchain are immutable and are available forever. This project demonstrates how to create certifications on blockchain. It comes with a smart contract, tests for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and an example of a frontend to interact with it.

Try the following commands to test and deploy the smart contract:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat accounts
npx harhat run scripts/deploy.js [--network ropsten]
```
